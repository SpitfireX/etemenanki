# Benchmarks

A set of benchmarks to test both the Ziggurat data model and Etemenanki implementation in practice.
These benchmarks consist of both technical benchmarks only concerning Ziggurat/Etemenanki and comparison benchmarks of Ziggurat/Etemenanki vs. the old CWB3.
Both the benchmarking code and a set of results should eventually end up in this directory.

See [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md) for more details on technical goals and specific test scenarios.
